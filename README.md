\section*{Project: Movie Recommendation System using Factorization Machines}

As part of my personal exploration into advanced machine learning methods, I designed and implemented a movie recommendation system leveraging factorization machines to predict user preferences. This project aimed to create a robust system capable of learning intricate relationships between users, movies, and metadata.

\subsection*{Key Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Integration}: Used a dataset comprising user ratings, movie metadata (e.g., genres, runtime, year), and categorical features (e.g., movie type: \texttt{tvSeries}, \texttt{short}, \texttt{video}) to enable comprehensive learning.
    \item \textbf{Feature Engineering}: Processed data to capture both explicit features (e.g., genres like \texttt{Action}, \texttt{Drama}) and implicit interactions (e.g., user preferences for specific time periods or genres).
    \item \textbf{Model Optimization}: Implemented a factorization machine using TensorFlow for efficient feature interaction learning, optimizing hyperparameters for performance.
    \item \textbf{Evaluation}: Achieved high predictive accuracy by fine-tuning parameters and validating results with metrics like RMSE and precision at K.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Impact}
This project demonstrates my ability to tackle real-world machine learning challenges, from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation. It showcases my proficiency in Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn, alongside my understanding of recommendation systems and collaborative filtering techniques.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience addressing complex ML problems, aligning with roles focused on advancing the state of the art in machine learning for innovative applications.
